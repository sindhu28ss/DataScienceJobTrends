# Data Science Job Market: A Trend Analysis Across Related Roles

## Project Overview

This project investigates current trends in the data science job market by scraping job postings from LinkedIn and analyzing the data using Python. It focuses on roles such as Data Scientist, Data Analyst, and Machine Learning Engineer, with the goal of understanding demand patterns, salary insights, and opportunities across the United States.

By leveraging libraries like BeautifulSoup for scraping and Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for analysis and visualization, this project aims to deliver meaningful insights for job seekers, recent graduates, and industry professionals.

## Objectives

- **Analyze Current Trends:**  Examine job role demand, industry distribution, and geographic patterns across different states.
- **Explore Salary Trends:**  Analyze average salaries across industries for various data science roles and identify top-paying sectors and companies.
- **Target Entry-Level Insights:** Provide focused insights for graduate students by identifying companies and industries hiring for entry-level and associate positions.

## Methodology

The project follows a structured approach from data extraction to insight generation:

### Data Extraction:
